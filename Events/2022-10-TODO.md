New idea:
- **Swarm of drones** or **fleet of heterogenous drones** ?
	- Current small drones can only deliver goods less than 5 pounds
	- To deliver large weight goods, we either use large-capacity drones or multiple drones to hold one unit
	- Large-capacity drones may result in large noise and energy consumption, even facing more restrictions
	- More robust, if one drone fails the central control just assign another to the swarm.
	- We may compare three modes: 
		- Conventional trucks + drones, where drones only carry light goods and only trucks can carry those large goods
		- Conventional trucks + fleet of drones, where large drones can carry large goods
		- Conventional trucks + swarm drones, multiple drones can cooperate to move large goods
	- This proposal is the "Compass" mode, i.e., to deliver both light and heavy goods, we choose **fleet of heterogenous drones** or swarm of drones? Whether we need the swarm drone delivery technique.

- Discuss the idea of middle version
