New idea:
- **Swarm of drones** or **fleet of heterogenous drones** ?
	- Current small drones can only deliver goods less than 5 pounds
	- To deliver large weight goods, we either use large-capacity drones or multiple drones to hold one unit
	- Large-capacity drones may result in large noise and energy consumption, even facing more restrictions
	- More robust, if one drone fails the central control just assign another to the swarm.
	- We may compare three modes: 
		- Conventional trucks + drones, where drones only carry light goods and only trucks can carry those large goods
		- Conventional trucks + fleet of drones, where large drones can carry large goods
		- Conventional trucks + swarm drones, multiple drones can cooperate to move large goods
	- This proposal is the "Compass" mode, i.e., to deliver both light and heavy goods, we choose **fleet of heterogenous drones** or swarm of drones? Whether we need the swarm drone delivery technique.

- Discuss the idea of middle version

- 无人机的载重问题
	- 用模块化无人机并联是否能解决问题？
	- 在研发成本上，推行模块化无人机和制造定制化的大容量无人机，哪个更有优势？
	- 多旋翼无人机**航时、载重**受到了局限
	- 思路：无人机受限于载重的数据 -> 常见方法是固定翼、大载重 -> 最新研究提出小型无人机串联方案 -> 这个方案的特点（好处是模块化、多重冗余，容易运作，缺点是技术实现难度大）-> 这项技术有没有前景 - 列一个物品质量分布
	- 固定翼无人机降落是个问题
