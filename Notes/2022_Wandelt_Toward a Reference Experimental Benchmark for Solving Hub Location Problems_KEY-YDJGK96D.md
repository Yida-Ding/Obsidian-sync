### Background
- Current situation:
	- Most hub location problems are NP-hard, leaving room for devising and tuning solution techniques, be it exact methods or heuristics.
	- Moreover, although some larger problems can be solved quite well, it is not well understood which solution approaches work best for various problems and why.
