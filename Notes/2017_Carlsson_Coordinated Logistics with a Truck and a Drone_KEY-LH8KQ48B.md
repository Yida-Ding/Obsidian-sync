## Introduction
- UAV advantage: UAVs have a low per-mile cost, can operate without human intervention, and can travel at high speeds while being unaffected by road traffic.
- UAV disadvantage: UAVs have an extremely low carrying capacity and short traveling radius, both of which necessitate frequent returns to a central depot.

- A conventional truck delivery system benefits from an economy of scale and suffers from high per-mile costs
- A UAV delivery system benefits from low per-mile costs and lacks an economy of scale.
- Assumption: 
	- Our model assumes that customers are distributed according to a known probability density in the Euclidean plane.
- Basic Tradeoff: One of the basic phenomena of interest to us is the trade-off between efficiency in transportation along a backbone network (in this case, the route of the truck) versus direct trips between locations (in this case, the direct trips taken by UAVs); this is arguably one of the fundamental dichotomies in transportation and logistics
- Continuous Approximation: 
	- The basic premise of the continuous approximation paradigm is the replacement of combinatorial quantities that are difficult to compute with simpler mathematical formulas, which (under certain conditions) provide accurate estimations of the desired quantity.
	- we treat the customer demand as coming from a probability density function
