### Major Research Question
- Which type of algorithm best fit which type of model?
	- For practioners and beginners in research, they may be surprised to see so many variants of models and techniques in the literature, how to find the best algorithm?
	- Sometimes, a single problem type (e.g., USApHMPC) may have multiple formulations, which depends on the construction of decision variables (e.g., flow-based being different from arc-based decision variable), thus leading to different exact solutions (e.g., $O(n^3),O(n^4)$) 
	- This can also find out whether the algorithm proposed in one article is applicable to the other variant problems.
- Not a survey in the traditional sense, but an experimental benchmark :
	- Report on the results of the largest benchmark performed in the field of DTCO
	- The study is an experimental benchmark, providing an empirical overview on the state-of-the-art solution algorithms for xx selected DTCO problems in terms of scalability and solution patterns.
	- Discuss how the insights obtained in our study lead to recommendations on future work
- Generate some valuable findings regarding various aspects:
	- Runtime, gap, memory, convergence, and etc.
