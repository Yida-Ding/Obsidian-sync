## Review
- This combination of truck and drone can exploit the benefits of both vehicle types:
	- the truck has a large capacity but usually low travel speed in urban areas;
	- the drone is faster and not restricted to street networks, but its range and carrying capacity are limited; and thus are not affected by (urban) congestion.
	- limited carriage capacity and flying range
	-
