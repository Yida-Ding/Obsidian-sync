## Remained Challenges
- After a drone completes a drop, the drone actually has the capability to fly directly to another customer for pickup instead of flying back to the depot and starting a new tour.
- A customer might order multiple products with different shipping priorities (or time-windows).
- Multiple depots hosting a fleet of trucks and a fleet of drones can be collectively orchestrated to achieve the operational excellence.

## Methodology
#### PDSTSP with drop & pickup synchronization at single depot (CP1)
- â€¢ Objective: The time required to service all customers by either the truck or the drone and return both vehicles to the depot must be minimized. â€¢ C1: Each task must be processed by one vehicle. â€¢ C2: The different travel-time of truck and drone must be considered, when the vehicle travels between nodes. â€¢ C3: Both trucks and drones must start from the depot. â€¢ C4: Both trucks and drones must return to the depot upon completing all tasks. â€¢ C5: Each customer must be served during a time-window. â€¢ C6: Drones are subject to a maximum flight endurance.
